# Automated Amazon Shopper
A python automation script that reads a text file of products you want to purchase on amazon and automatically orders it for you!

By using Selenium webdrivers to navigate chrome, and BeautifulSoup to parse the page for the needed information, it is able to find the products that match your every single word in your text file of orders and selects the highest rated one to ensure that it selects a quality product. Assuming that you don't want to sit through it if you have a large order, it also includes a function that emails you a screenshot of your cart when it is ready and then asks if you would like to purchase it because it executes the order. 

I am currently working on a way to automaitcally select another product if the user responds by saying "no".
